# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction App

A **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** using machine learning. This project is built with breast cancer awareness in mind and utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for high-accuracy predictions.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- Input tumor feature values to predict whether the tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign**.
- View a visually appealing and interactive interface inspired by breast cancer awareness themes.
- Leverage the power of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

Key features include:
- **Interactive UI**: Streamlit-powered interface for seamless user interaction.
- **High Accuracy**: The ANN model achieves an accuracy of **96.74%**.
- **Breast Cancer Awareness**: The design incorporates visual elements supporting breast cancer awareness.
